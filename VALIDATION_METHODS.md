# 🧪 HMSE Validation and Experimental Methodology

## 1. Purpose and Scope

This document defines the **validation, testing, and evaluation methodology** for the **HyperDrive Microcontroller Storage Engine (HMSE)**.  
It establishes a formal process to empirically verify the system’s **compression performance**, **architectural correctness**, **resource efficiency**, and **practical viability** on microcontroller-class hardware (ESP32-S3).

The primary goal is to validate that HMSE achieves **multi-layer deduplication and compression** sufficient to approach or surpass a **5–9.375:1 compression factor**, while operating within the memory, compute, and I/O constraints of the ESP32-S3 platform.

### 1.3 Pre-registration and Transparency

This validation methodology was **pre-registered** before data collection to prevent p-hacking and HARKing (Hypothesizing After Results are Known).

**Pre-registration includes:**
- Hypotheses (H₀ and H₁)
- Sample sizes and stopping rules
- Statistical tests and significance thresholds
- Primary vs. exploratory analyses

**Deviations from plan:**
Any deviations from this methodology during execution will be documented in `VALIDATION_REPORT.md` with justification.

**Open Science Commitment:**
- All raw data, scripts, and logs archived in `/validation/`
- Pre-registered plan available at: `[OSF/Zenodo DOI]`

## 2. Experimental Objectives

### 2.1 Primary Objectives
1. **Validate compression performance**
   - Confirm total reduction ratio ≥ 5:1 (target = 9.375:1)
   - Measure entropy reduction per layer (L1–L4)

2. **Verify architectural correctness**
   - Confirm data integrity through reversible encoding/decoding cycles  
   - Verify that chunking, hashing, and deduplication layers produce consistent indices and deltas

3. **Assess hardware feasibility**
   - Ensure all layers execute within ESP32-S3 resource limits (PSRAM, flash, CPU)
   - Measure processing time and throughput for typical workloads

### 2.2 Secondary Objectives
1. Quantify **PSRAM utilization**, **I/O bandwidth**, and **energy consumption**
2. Evaluate **deduplication effectiveness** across corpus redundancy patterns
3. Identify **failure thresholds** (corpus size, entropy, fragmentation)
4. Benchmark performance vs. established compression baselines (e.g., BZ2, ZIM)

## 3. Experimental Setup

### 3.1 Hardware Environment

| Component | Description |

| **Storage** | 8 GB microSD (benchmark), 16 GB (optional extended test) |
| **Power** | USB-C 5 V @ 500 mA (max), power logging via INA219 |
| **Firmware Framework** | ESP-IDF v5.3 + FreeRTOS kernel |
| **Interfaces Used** | SDMMC, USB MSC/CDC, UART debug |
| **Compiler Flags** | `-O2`, `-ffast-math`, `-mlongcalls`, `-mfix-esp32-psram-cache-issue` |

### 3.2 Software Stack

### 3.3 Reproducibility Requirements

**Software Versions:**
- ESP-IDF: v5.3.0 (commit hash: `[to be specified]`)
- Python: 3.11.6
- Toolchain: `xtensa-esp32s3-elf-gcc` 13.2.0

**Random Seed Control:**

To ensure **bitwise reproducibility**, all random operations use fixed seeds:

| Operation | Seed | Implementation | Purpose |
|-----------|------|----------------|---------|
| **Dataset sampling** | `random.seed(42)` | Python `numpy.random` | Wikipedia article selection for subsets (1GB/5GB/10GB) |
| **Corpus subset generation** | `random.seed(42)` | Python `random` module | Random sampling for stratified test sets |
| **Chunk selection testing** | `0xDEADBEEF` | C `srand()` in firmware | PSRAM cache eviction testing, stress test selection |
| **MinHash permutations** | **Deterministic (not random)** | Seeds: `[1, 2, 3, ..., 128]` | Hash functions use sequential seeds for 128 permutations; no randomness required |
| **FastCDC boundaries** | **Content-defined (not random)** | Rabin fingerprint polynomial | Boundaries determined by content hash (H ≡ 0 mod P); fully deterministic given input |

**Verification:**
- All random operations logged to `validation/logs/random_operations.log`
- Rerunning with same seeds must produce identical chunk boundaries, compression ratios, and index sizes
- Python script `verify_determinism.py` confirms bitwise-identical outputs across runs

**Configuration Files:**
- `sdkconfig`: Archived in `/validation/config/sdkconfig.baseline`
- Compiler flags: `-O2 -ffast-math -DCONFIG_SPIRAM_SPEED_80M`

**Replication Package:**
Available at: `[repository URL]/validation/replication-package-v1.0.tar.gz`
- Contains: firmware source, datasets, scripts, configs, expected outputs

## 4. Datasets

### 4.1 Primary Corpus
| Dataset | Source | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **English Wikipedia Dump** | `enwiki-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2` from dumps.wikimedia.org | ~75 GB uncompressed XML; highly redundant text corpus |

### 4.2 Derived Subsets
To accommodate limited MCU RAM and I/O:
1. **1 GB subset**: Randomly sampled article blocks (~50 000 articles)
2. **5 GB subset**: High-redundancy category set (science + culture)
3. **10 GB subset**: Uniform sampling for scalability testing

### 4.3 Diverse Corpora for Generalization Testing

**⚠️ Critical Requirement:** To address selection bias, the following additional corpora **must** be tested to demonstrate that performance is not Wikipedia-specific:

| Corpus | Source | Size | Expected CF | Redundancy Profile | Purpose |
|--------|--------|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|
| **arXiv Papers** | arxiv.org bulk download | 10 GB | **2-3:1** (low) | Unique scientific notation, minimal templates | **Pessimistic case** |
| **GitHub Repos** | GH Archive sample | 10 GB | **3-5:1** (medium) | Code redundancy (functions, imports) | **Code vs. text comparison** |
| **News Articles** | Common Crawl | 10 GB | **4-6:1** (medium) | Temporal redundancy, boilerplate | **Real-world text** |
| **Random Data** | `/dev/urandom` | 1 GB | **1.0:1** (none) | Incompressible | **Worst-case baseline** |

**Reporting Requirement:**
- Report performance as **range** (min, median, max) across all corpora
- Explicitly label Wikipedia as "best-case scenario"
- Identify which corpus represents "typical" performance for general deployment

**Rationale:** Wikipedia's high structural redundancy (templates, infoboxes, citations) creates optimistic compression factors that may not apply to other text types (scientific papers, news, code). Generalizability requires diverse testing.

### 4.4 Comparison Baselines
| Compression Method | Implementation | Reference |
|--------------------|----------------|------------|
| **BZ2** | bzip2 v1.0.8 | Wikipedia official |
| **ZIM** | Kiwix openzim | Wikipedia offline standard |
| **zstd -19** | Facebook Zstandard | High-performance reference |

---

## 5. Evaluation Metrics

| Category | Metric | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Compression** | **Total compression factor (CF)** | Input / output ratio after full pipeline |
| | **Per-layer gain** | Ratio improvement contributed by L1–L4 individually |
| **Integrity** | **Reconstruction fidelity** | Byte-exact match after full encode/decode cycle |
| **Performance** | **Throughput** | KB/s processed during encode/decode |
| | **Latency per MB** | Time to process 1 MB segment |
| **Resource Usage** | **PSRAM usage** | Peak allocation (tracked via `heap_caps_get_free_size`) |
| | **Flash I/O throughput** | MB/s from SDMMC driver metrics |
| **Power** | **Average W consumed** | Measured with INA219 over 1 minute sample window |
| **Deduplication** | **Unique chunk ratio** | Unique chunks / total chunks (%) |
| | **Similarity hit rate** | LSH matches / candidate pairs (%) |

### 5.5 Statistical Analysis Framework

**Hypothesis Testing:**

**Primary Hypothesis (Two-Tailed):**
- **H₀**: μ_CF = 3.0 (HMSE performs equivalently to BZ2 baseline)
- **H₁**: μ_CF ≠ 3.0 (HMSE differs from baseline)
- **Significance level**: α = 0.05
- **Statistical test**: Two-sample t-test (HMSE vs. BZ2)

**Secondary Hypothesis (One-Tailed, if H₁ confirmed):**
- **H₀**: μ_CF ≤ 5.0 (Below MVP threshold)
- **H₁**: μ_CF > 5.0 (Exceeds MVP threshold)
- **Significance level**: α = 0.05

**Sample Size and Power Analysis (Corrected):**
- **Minimum trials per dataset**: n = 30 runs
- **Power (1-β)**: 0.80 (80% probability to detect true effect)
- **Minimum Detectable Effect Size (MDES)**: 
  - Calculated (not assumed): MDES = t_(critical) × σ / √n
  - For n=30, α=0.05, two-tailed: MDES ≈ **0.52** (Cohen's d)
  - **Interpretation**: Study can detect CF differences ≥ 0.5:1 with 80% confidence
  - **Limitation**: Improvements smaller than 0.5:1 (e.g., 5.2:1 vs. 5.5:1) may not reach statistical significance

**Implication:** The study is **not powered** to detect small incremental improvements. It can only distinguish between "substantially better" (CF > 5.5:1) vs. "marginally better" (CF ≈ 5:1) with low confidence.

**Confidence Intervals:**
- Report 95% CI for all compression factor measurements
- Bootstrap resampling (B=1000) for non-normal distributions

**Measurement Precision:**

| Metric | Precision | Instrument | Calibration |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Compression Factor | ±0.1:1 | File size comparison | N/A |
| Throughput | ±5% | `esp_timer_get_time()` | System clock verified |
| Power | ±0.01 W | INA219 | Factory calibrated |
| Latency | ±10 µs | Hardware timer | Crystal oscillator 40 MHz ±20 ppm |

### 5.6 Measurement Error and Uncertainty

| Metric | Systematic Error | Random Error | Mitigation |
|--------|------------------|--------------|------------|
| **File size** | ±0 bytes | N/A | Direct filesystem query |
| **Timer (latency)** | ±20 µs (clock drift) | ±5 µs | Use `esp_timer_get_time()` |
| **Power (INA219)** | ±0.5% FS (±2.5 mW) | ±0.1 mW | Average over 60s windows |
| **PSRAM usage** | ±4 KB (allocator) | N/A | Call `heap_caps_get_free_size()` |

**Error Propagation:**
For derived metrics (e.g., MB/s = bytes / time):
- Throughput error: δT = T × √[(δB/B)² + (δt/t)²]
- Report all derived metrics with propagated uncertainty

## 6. Validation Procedure

### 6.1 Functional Validation
1. Encode → Decode loop with checksum verification (SHA-256 end-to-end)  
2. Validate per-layer checkpoints (L1→L2→L3→L4) for lossless behavior  
3. Confirm chunk boundaries and indices persist across re-runs  

### 6.2 Performance Validation
1. Process each dataset subset sequentially  
2. Record timing and throughput via internal log timestamps  
3. Measure PSRAM and flash usage at each stage  

### 6.3 Comparative Validation
1. Compress the same corpus using BZ2, ZIM, and zstd on host system  
2. Compare resulting compression factors and reconstruction integrity  
3. Evaluate energy efficiency (MB/J) and throughput vs. reference systems

#### 6.3.1 Fair Comparison Protocol

**Objective:** Ensure baseline comparisons (BZ2, ZIM, zstd) use equivalent configurations.

| Baseline | Configuration | Justification |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **bzip2** | Default (`-9`) | Wikipedia official compression |
| **zstd** | Level 19 | Comparable compression ratio to BZ2 |
| **ZIM (Kiwix)** | Default | Wikipedia offline standard |

**Controlled Variables:**
- All methods process **same input**: Decompressed Wikipedia XML (not BZ2 file)
- Same hardware for baseline tests: x86-64, 16 GB RAM, Ubuntu 22.04
- Exclude index overhead from all methods (compare payload only)
- Report both "standalone" and "with index" sizes for fairness

**Measurement Protocol:**
1. Decompress Wikipedia dump: `bzip2 -d enwiki.xml.bz2`
2. Compress with each method: `time [method] < input.xml > output.[ext]`
3. Record: wall-clock time, final size, peak memory usage
4. Compute CF = Input size / Output size (payload only)

**Acknowledgment:**
- HMSE includes deduplication indices (5.6% overhead)
- Baseline comparisons adjusted to include equivalent index sizes
- Report both "raw" and "fair" (index-inclusive) compression factors

### 6.4 Stress Testing
1. Push input corpus size until failure or resource exhaustion  
2. Record entropy threshold where pipeline breakdown occurs  
3. Identify memory fragmentation or task starvation events in FreeRTOS logs

### 6.5 Ablation Studies

**Objective:** Isolate the contribution of each layer to overall compression.

| Configuration | L1 | L2 | L3 | L4 | Expected CF | Purpose |
|---------------|----|----|----|----|-------------|---------|
| **Baseline** | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ | 3:1 | Isolate L1 (DEFLATE) contribution |
| **+CDC** | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | 3:1 | Verify CDC doesn't change CF (boundary detection only) |
| **+Dedupe** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | 5-7:1 | Isolate L3 (exact dedupe) contribution |
| **Full Pipeline** | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 9.375:1 | Complete system |
| **L4 Only** | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | 1.5-2:1 | Isolate L4 (similarity) contribution |

**Analysis:**
- For each configuration, run on 5 GB Wikipedia subset (n=10 trials)
- Measure mean CF and 95% CI
- Compute statistical significance of each layer's contribution (paired t-test)
- Report: "L3 contributes Δ = 2.1 ± 0.3:1 improvement (p < 0.001)"

## 7. Success Criteria

| Tier | Target CF | Description | Success Definition |
|------|------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **Tier 4 (Full)** | ≥ 9.375 : 1 | 100% Wikipedia coverage on 8 GB card | Demonstration success |
| **Tier 3** | 7–9.375 : 1 | ≥ 75% coverage | Achievable; practical system |
| **Tier 2 (MVP)** | 5–7 : 1 | ≥ 50% coverage | Minimum viable; validates design |
| **Tier 1** | 3–5 : 1 | Partial corpus | Proof-of-concept only |
| **Tier 0** | < 3 : 1 | Below BZ2 baseline | Failure condition |

---

## 8. Risk and Contingency Plan

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|-------|----------------------|
| **Insufficient compression (< 5:1)** | Optimize L3 hash tables; expand PSRAM index; test delta encoding |
| **Excessive latency** | Implement task-level parallelism; offload I/O to second core |
| **PSRAM fragmentation** | Use static buffers and pooled allocation |
| **Flash wear-leveling degradation** | Enable SDMMC wear-leveling; maintain write journals |
| **Entropy mismatch (non-redundant data)** | Substitute corpus with higher redundancy subset for validation |
| **Thermal or power limits** | Limit duty cycle, add temperature telemetry |

### 8.5 Threats to Validity

#### Internal Validity (Can we trust the causal claims?)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Instrumentation effects** | Use calibrated INA219; verify timer accuracy with oscilloscope |
| **History effects** | Control for thermal throttling (monitor ESP32-S3 temperature) |
| **Selection bias** | Use stratified random sampling for Wikipedia subsets |
| **Implementation artifacts** | Compare against reference implementations (zlib, bzip2) |

#### External Validity (Can results generalize?)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Corpus selection bias (CRITICAL)** | **Wikipedia exhibits optimal characteristics for deduplication** (high structural redundancy, templates, standardized formatting). This is a **best-case scenario** that may not generalize. **Required**: Test on diverse corpora with varying redundancy profiles: <br>1. **arXiv papers** (low redundancy, unique scientific notation)<br>2. **GitHub repositories** (code vs. text comparison)<br>3. **News articles** (temporal redundancy, current events)<br>4. **Synthetic random data** (worst-case baseline, ~1.0:1 CF)<br>**Report performance range** (min, median, max) across corpora and acknowledge Wikipedia as optimistic. |
| **Hardware specificity** | Acknowledge results specific to ESP32-S3; discuss ARM Cortex-M7 comparison |
| **Wikipedia version drift** | Document exact dump version; archive dataset for replication |
| **Workload realism** | Justify Wikipedia as representative of structured text corpora (**with caveat** that other text types may perform worse) |

#### Construct Validity (Are we measuring what we claim?)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Compression factor definition** | Clearly define: Input (decompressed) / Output (physical storage) |
| **Throughput measurement** | Exclude I/O wait time; measure only CPU processing time |
| **Deduplication rate** | Distinguish "exact duplicate" from "similar" chunks |

#### Conclusion Validity (Are statistical inferences sound?)

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Low statistical power** | Require n ≥ 30 trials per configuration |
| **Multiple comparisons** | Apply Bonferroni correction when comparing >2 configurations |
| **Outlier sensitivity** | Report both mean and median; use robust statistics |
